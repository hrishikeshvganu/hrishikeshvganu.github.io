A loss like NDCG takes into account this consideration.
\[NDCG@k = \sum_{1}^{k}GAIN(i) DISCOUNT(i) \]
Note: I use x&lt;- y  to denote that x depends on y.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>DISCOUNT depends on the rank (r).</li>
<li>DISCOUNT&lt;-Rank&lt;- Predicted score (\(S_i\))</li>
<li>\(S_{i}\)&lt;-\(\Theta\) (parameters over which the NDCG can be optimized)</li>
</ul>
<p>
However the rank of a product is a step function of the predicted score.

<p>
<b>Therefore need to find a proxy that's differentiable and is an upper bound for NDCG or similar losses that matter to business</b>

It's not easy since it's an inverse problem. I'll go into the theory later but I'll be practical and discuss an algorithm called LambdaRank that has been very successful in the real world. I'll provide a hand wavy sketch of how it works (not a proof. There might not be a proof so I'll focus on the emprical)

</div>

<p>
\[ \mathrm{Force}_{k,l} = \lambda_{k,l}  \mathrm{Scalefactor}(k,l) \Delta NDCG (k,l) \]
Where $ Scalefactor(k,l)$ is a scaling factor from 0 to 1. This factor is larger if the difference in scores of \(k\) and \(l\) is large and negative. \(\Delta NDCG (k,l)\) is the change in NDCG if the product positons are swapped.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The "force" is used as the residual (gradient of the training loss) that has to be optimized through iterations of gradient boosting.</li>
<li>Thus a pair of products in mutually incorrect order gets a higher penalty if the difference in current scores is large and negative.</li>

The following strategies fall under this header:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="org4bc634e"></a>Using GPUs<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org4bc634e">
<p>
GPUs have thousands of cores and can perform operations in parallel on multiple instances through batching.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org2a32061"></a>Using models that can work on the same instance in parallel<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org2a32061">
<p>
This strategy can be used if the score can be <b>decomposed</b> into components that can be added together. Usually this property is restricted to linear models. This strategy uptil about 2013 before the era of deep learning. Even in today's world where full attribution of the score into individual components at an instance level is needed this is one of the most suitable strategies. Eg: credit scoring systems where one might want to understand how much reduction in credit score was due to (say) a late credit card payment  in a specific month[which would be a feature in the model].
Eg: in the following equation, <b>Delinquent CC</b>, <b>Full time job</b> can be indicator variables (0/1) and due to decomposability each effect \(w_{x} x\)  can be separately computed.
\[\mathrm{Score}= w_{\mathrm{Delinquent CC}\mathrm{Delinquent CC} + w_{\mathrm{Full time job}} \mathrm{Full time job} + ..\]
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> in today's world not many companies use such models for search ranking but when used it allows for massive parallelism.

<h3 id="org13e6656">Inference latency</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org13e6656">
<p>
Of the the three consideratios, in most Internet companies latency matters the most. Each 100ms in latency costs hard dollars. There are 3 ways to reduce the inference latency. Here we talk about only unit latency (latency for a single prediction) so that we don't have to worry about throughput
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgd7c1305" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgd7c1305">Do less work</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd7c1305">
<p>
Model cascades are one mechanism through which the average case unit latency can be brought down.
The key idea is:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A cascade has n stages.</li>
<li>At each stage there's a choice:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>that the instance can exit the cascade and a prediction is generated</li>
<li>else the instance passes to the next model in the cascade</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The choice depends on the features of the instance. Assumption is that there is a mapping \(\bar{x}: \rightarrow {1,2, \ldots, n}\) of features \(\bar{x}\) to the stage at which the instance can exit the cascade</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org50400c9">
<p>
This is about optimizations that exploit the features of the computer architecture like memory layout, vectorization capability etc to design optimized systems. The idea is not to reduce the # high level computations but to execute them more faster.
